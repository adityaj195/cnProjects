                HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it is the "code" behind every webpage-even this one.
                If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task.HTML,without styling, 
                can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps
                you to structure the content correctly, which is important whn you sit down to add style to your HTML.

            However simple this might seen, it is mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development. 
            Various tools easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process- but if you want to be in full control of your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
            <br>
            Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks that'll help you to get up and running.
            Reading this, you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your won good!

        <h1>
            Step One - TAGS
        </h1>
        <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png">
        <p>
            Tags are what youl'll see the most when you look HTML souce code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content
            enclosed by them.
            <br>
            Let's look at two types of tags:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>I need a closing tag</li>
                <li>I don't need a closing tag</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and seconf one is called is closing tag. 
            Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very commonly used wxamples of such tags are 
            &lt html &gt, 
            &lt head &gt, 
            &lt body &gt, 
            &lt strong &gt 
            etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second example of tags about loner tages - as in, they don't need a closing tag to function. Although it's not required, these of tags are 
            ofthen written as &lt tags/ &gt to make the debugging of code easier.
            common examples of such tags are &lt hr/ &gt - used for horizontal line, &lt br/ &gt- to break the line, etc.  
        </p>
        <h1>
            Step Two - HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document
        </h1>
        <div>
            <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the signficant parts of your HTML code.

            <ol type=" radio">
                <li> &lt BODY  /BODY &gt  is palced below your &lt HEAD &gt tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen 
                    comes under this tag. Text, images, links and pretty much anything you can see in your browser live inside this tag. </li> 
                <li>
                    &lt HTML /HTML &gt wraps your entire code. Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt HEAD /HEAD &gt includes things like title, styles, and scripts. Head is usually present at the top(hah!), just inside the &lt /HTML &gt tag.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h1>
            Step three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty
        </h1>
        <p>
            now that you know how to step up the skelonton of your document, let's proceed with the things that will go inside your &lt BODY &gt tag and do some magic! 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol type ="radio">
                <li> 
                    &lt b /b &gt makes your text look bold 
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt i /i &gt makes your write in <i>cursive</i> 
                </li>
                <Li>
                    &lt u /u &gt <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote 
                </Li>
            </ol>
            
            For example, this piece of code
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            &lt html &gt
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt head  /head &gt
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt body &gt 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &lt i &gt I am italics! &lt /i &gt &lt br/ &gt 
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt b &gt I am bold! &lt b &gt &lt br/ &gt
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt u &gt And me, well. I'm underlined! &lt /u &gt &lt br/ &gt
            <br> 
            <br>
            
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt /body &gt
            <br>
            <br>
            &lt /html &gt
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Sould produce something like this on your browser: Dont't fret too much about the &lt br/ &gt. It's just for breaking line so that you can start from the next line. Enter key
            does little when it comes to changing linesin your HTML document.

            </h4>
            <p>
                Html provide you with six tags, from
                &lt H1 /H1 &gt to &lt H6 /H6 &gt 
                to help you create different sized headers quickly.

                Inserting an Image:
            </h4>
            <p>
                All that's good, but what fun without images on webpage? Don't worry, &lt IMG &gt to the rescue!
                The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source". Basically, it tells the browser where it should 
                look for the image. The syntax goes something like:
                </p>
                <p>
                &lt img scr="path_to_your_image"/&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you 
                want your image to take.
                </p>
            <h4>
                Lists:
            </h4>
            <p>
                HTML has two types of lists- orderd and unorderd. Each time of your list has to be enclosed in a tag.
                The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supoose you want to create a list like
                <ol type ="radio">
                    <li>Item1</li>
                    <li>Item2</li>
                    <li>Item3</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Following code will easily do the job for you:
            </p>
            <hr>
            &lt ul &gt
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li Item1 /li &gt
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li Item2 /li &gt
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li Item3 /li &gt
            <br>
            &lt ul  &gt
            <hr>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            This, by the way, was an example of an unorderd list. For an ordered list, all you need to do is replace 
            &lt ul &gt with &lt ol &gt and &lt ol &gt and &lt /ul &gt with &lt /ol &gt        
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see what the following code does:
        </p>
        <hr>

        &lt html &gt
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp &lt head    /head  &gt
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &lt body &gt
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt ul &gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &lt li I am unorderd list's item 1! /li /&gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &lt li I am unorderd list's item 2! /li /&gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &lt li I am unorderd list's item 3! /li /&gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &lt li I am unorderd list's item 4! /li /&gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp   &lt/ul&gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt ol &gt
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt li I am ordered list's item1! /&gt
        <br>

        &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt li I am ordered list's item4! /&gt
        <br>
